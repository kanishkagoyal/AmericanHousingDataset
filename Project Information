Abstract---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main objective of this project was to predict Sale Price of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa. For the analysis and modeling purposes, 
the data set was taken from Kaggle - Ames Housing Dataset. The objective here, was broken down into 8 smaller questions of interest, which were then 
transformed to data science problems. This involved time series analysis on Sale Price. It also involved , Uni-variate, Bi-variate and Multi-variable 
analysis on varied set of variables. Analysis was conducted on features, such as how neighborhood, lot size, no. of bedrooms etc. can affect the Sale 
price of a property. Visualization was performed by creating distribution, comparison, and regression plots. Additionally, Feature engineering was 
conducted to convert a few Ordinal variables to factors. Few variables were mutated to the data set as per requirement. After a detailed analysis, 
three models were built to predict the sale price. On evaluating these models, the model with the best fit was selected. Analysis showed that Overall 
Quality, Neighborhood and Living area happen to be the major factors in depicting the Sale Price of residential property in Ames, Lowa. The final model 
has an RMSE of 0.149. New insights gained throughtout the project mentioned in the end of the report.

Problem Identification---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Problem 1 - Analyze if age of the House has an impact on sale price across different types of foundation.
    Problem 2 - Analyze whether Basement/ Garage has any effect on sale price.
    Problem 3 - How has the Average Sale Price changed from year 2006 to 2010 across different neighborhoods?
    Problem 4 - Are quality/ condition features affecting sale price?
    Problem 5 - Does the sale price fluctuate across seasons of the year?
    Problem 6 - Analyze if Lot size, or various other area measurements make an impact on sale price.
    Problem 7 - Analyze other key features to find what best predicts the sale price.
    Problem 8 - How are Number of Sales distributed among neighborhoods/ Building type across time?
    Problem 9 - Develop models to predict Sale Price based on the analysis performed in previous steps.
    Problem 10 - Evaluate the models created and select the fit that best predicts the sales price.
